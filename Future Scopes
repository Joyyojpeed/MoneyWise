## Future Scopes

The Money Tracker project is a work in progress, and several features and improvements are planned for future releases. Below are some of the ideas for future enhancements:

### 1. **User Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement a user authentication system to allow users to securely log in and track their finances across devices.
   - Features to include:
     - Sign up / Log in / Logout
     - Password recovery
     - JWT-based session management
   - This would allow users to have personalized data.

### 2. **Transaction Categories**
   - Add the ability for users to categorize their transactions (e.g., "Food", "Bills", "Entertainment").
   - Users should be able to filter transactions by categories to gain better insights into their spending habits.

### 3. **Recurring Transactions**
   - Enable users to set up recurring transactions (e.g., monthly bills, subscriptions) that automatically appear in their transaction history.
   - This feature will help users automate repetitive expense tracking.

### 4. **Graphical Data Visualizations**
   - Introduce charts and graphs to visualize spending trends, categorized expenses, and savings goals.
   - Use libraries like **Chart.js** or **D3.js** to display graphical representations of financial data.
   - Allow users to filter data by time range and view summary charts.

### 5. **Budgeting & Spending Limits**
   - Implement budgeting functionality that allows users to set monthly or yearly spending limits for each category.
   - Alert users when they exceed their set budgets.

### 6. **Data Backup & Restore**
   - Implement a data backup system to allow users to back up their financial data and restore it in case of loss.
   - Integrate cloud-based backup solutions or local file backups.

### 7. **Multi-currency Support**
   - Add multi-currency support for users who track finances in different currencies.
   - Integrate a currency conversion API to allow seamless conversion between multiple currencies.

### 8. **Dark Mode**
   - Implement a dark mode toggle for the user interface to improve accessibility and user comfort.

### 9. **Transaction Search & Filter**
   - Add advanced search options to filter transactions based on categories, dates, and amounts.
   - Users will be able to find specific transactions quickly and efficiently.
